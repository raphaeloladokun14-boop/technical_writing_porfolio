## API Documentation Case Study: Authentication & User Services

### Overview
Documented REST APIs for authentication and user management services to support developer integration and system understanding.

### Problem
The APIs lacked clear, centralized documentation, making integration difficult and error-prone for developers.

### What I Did
- Documented authentication and user-related endpoints
- Defined request/response schemas, headers, and authentication flows
- Clarified error responses and common usage scenarios
- Structured documentation for consistency and readability

### Tools & Technologies
- REST APIs
- Markdown
- Swagger / OpenAPI (reference)

### Outcome
- Improved clarity and usability of the APIs
- Reduced ambiguity around authentication and error handling
